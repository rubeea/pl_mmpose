Simple 3D baseline proposes to break down the task of 3d human pose estimation into 2 stages: (1) Image → 2D pose
(2) 2D pose → 3D pose.

The authors find that “lifting” ground truth 2D joint locations to 3D space is a task that can be solved with a low error rate.
Based on the success of 2d human pose estimation, it directly "lifts" 2d joint locations to 3d space.
